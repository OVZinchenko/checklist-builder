1. Outline the initial steps you would take to transition the frontend/backend to support an offline-first approach.

I think that both the frontend and backend parts need to write error handlers that may occur when the Internet connection is lost. This is necessary so that if such an error occurs, we can process it and the application does not crash and continues to work.


2. Drawing from your own experience with offline functionalities, what challenges have you encountered when implementing or maintaining offline modes?

I had no experience working with standalone applications, but there were examples when I made requests from/to the server, and in case of any errors, I saved the data or retrieved it from local storage


3. How did you overcome these challenges, or what solutions did you implement?

I think that the difficulty may be that there can be many errors with connection loss and for various reasons, so to solve them you need to work closely with the backend developer to cover the maximum possible events and scenarios


4. Are there any particular tools, libraries, or practices you've found especially helpful or problematic in this context?

I think there are libraries that can be used instead of local storage, and they also support an additional mode for working in offline mode. For example, the most common data storage manager for react now is redux and they have an additional utility redux-offline, there are certainly methods for working offline, since it is a data storage with the ability to process it

5. Are there any emerging technologies or trends that might influence how we think about offline experiences?

I believe that this technology is currently very narrowly focused, and there are very few tools or trends, but precisely those applications that need this direction and those where libraries covering these needs will be used will try to cover exactly the functionality that is necessary for offline mode
